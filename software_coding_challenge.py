Design a parent class called Planet

It must have:
- General attributes: name, distance_from_sun, planet_type
- A get_distance_to_earth() method that gives you the absolute distance from the Earth.

!!! You can take the distance from the Sun to the Earth as 147 million kilometres !!!

For example, if the planetâ€™s distance_from_sun was 148 million kilometres when you call the get_distance_from_earth()
method, it should give us the distance like this: {'distance to earth': 1000000} where the implied unit is kilometres.
This means that the planet is 1 million kilometres away from Earth.

> This question uses an oversimplification of the solar system model, not taking into account orbit position or the
eccentricity of the orbit, so in reality the result will be an approximate value with a reasonable margin of error.

B] Design a child class called Mercury, which inherits from the Planet class.
This class should have exactly the same attributes as its parent class.
Your child class should also have a static method called happy_new_year(), which
would give us the information on how long a year lasts on the planet (in whatever way you wish!). 
You can take Earth Days as the implied unit.

After, create a Mercury object and print out the value of all its attributes and methods.
